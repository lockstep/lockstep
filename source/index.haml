          Move Loot: Special Projects and Team Extension
        %p.text-center
          Lockstep teams worked closely with
          Move Loot's core development group on a variety of ambitious
          initiatives, including an integrated inventory management application
          for furniture retailers and a custom logistics system that powered
          Move Loot's complex distribution network. Lockstep also supported legacy
          Move Loot infrastructure, including their marketing systems and the
          core Marketplace application.
        %p.text-center
          Move Loot ceased operations in June 2016 but we are happy
          to demo snapshots of these projects by request.

              solution that tied directly into the highly trafficked Move Loot
              Marketplace. Furniture vendors from small consignment shops
              to national retailers leveraged Trade to track in-house
              supply and channel sales through Move Loot's extensive buyer
              network.
            %p
              Trade was powered by some of our favorite technologies, including
              a Ruby on Rails API and an interactive ReactJS front end.

              Move Loot moved literally <i>tons</i> of furniture all over
              the country, from sellers to warehouses to buyers
              or the appropriate recycling facilities. Their massive
              coordination effort was handled smoothly with Transporter, a custom
              logistics solution perfectly tailored to Move Loot's unique
              needs.
            %p
              Transporter communicated with a series of systems in
              order to move products from A to B, including the Move Loot
              Marketplace and one of Move Loot's proprietary mobile
              applications. The core system was written in Ruby and the
              front end was ReactJS coupled with Reflux (an offshoot of
              Facebook's Flux architecture).

          Only two things scare lawyers: Trust accounting and other lawyers. This exciting
          SaaS solution makes trust accounting dead simple, and ensures that lawyers
          stay compliant with their State Bar without hiring expensive specialists. TrustBooks
          has built-in controls to ensure firms stay on track while managing all of the necessary
          workflows, from printing checks to reconciling accounts. Think of QuickBooks
          without the headache.

      .col-sm-6
        %p
          Our priorities during the Version 1 build were simplicity and security. Since
          accounting tools are intrinsically complex we followed a rigorous "front first"
          approach to test workflows before any backend functionality was added.
          And given the sensitive nature of the legal market we took extra precautions against
          malicious use. TrustBooks users can be confident that their data is being
          protected by best practice architecture and best-in-class infrastructure
          providers.

          We don't know what the future of journalism looks like, but it probably isn't
          bundles of paper being hurled at your door by passing cyclists.
          Instead our bet was on Noozible: News that was "curated, shared and discussed by and
          with your friends, unfiltered by traditional media." The Noozible team
          gave serious news enthusiasts the means to create and share their own
          "noozpapers" in a news-based social network.

      .col-sm-6
        %p
          Our strategy with Noozible was fast product execution to get core features
          into the hands of beta testers as soon as possible. Simple workflows
          and minimalist design let the main draw of Noozible
          shine through: User-generated news stories. We worked with the Noozible team
          from day one to implement core value features for the MVP and
          usage analytics tools that collected rich engagement data.
          Ultimately these data informed the decision to discontinue after the pilot
          by carefully measuring KPIs against user acquisition cost
          and lifetime value analyses.
